      <h2>About Pokepath TD</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Pokepath TD</strong> is a strategic tower defense game where smart planning
        and precise unit placement determine your success. Enemies follow predefined paths,
        and your mission is to stop them before they reach the end by building and upgrading
        powerful defensive units.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike fast-paced action games, Pokepath TD focuses on long-term strategy.
        Each wave introduces stronger enemies and more complex attack patterns,
        pushing you to adapt your build rather than relying on a single setup.
      </p>

      <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
      <p>
        The core gameplay revolves around placing towers along enemy routes and managing
        limited resources. You earn currency by defeating enemies, which can be spent
        on upgrading existing units or unlocking stronger defenses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Timing is crucial. Investing too early in upgrades may leave you vulnerable later,
        while saving too much can cause you to be overwhelmed by stronger waves.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Classic tower defense gameplay with strategic depth</li>
        <li>Progressive enemy waves that increase in difficulty</li>
        <li>Upgrade-focused progression system</li>
        <li>Optimized performance for desktop and mobile browsers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mouse / Tap:</strong> Place and upgrade towers</li>
        <li><strong>Click:</strong> Select units and interact with the interface</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile:</strong> Fully playable with touch input</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you enjoy games that reward strategic thinking and careful planning,
        Pokepath TD offers a satisfying challenge that grows more intense with every level.
